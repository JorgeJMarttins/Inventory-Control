# Inventory Control System

This is a simple console application for managing an inventory system. The system allows users to add, list, edit, and remove products from the inventory. The application is built in C# and stores product details in memory during runtime.

## Features

- **Add Product**: Add new products to the inventory, specifying the name, quantity, and price.
- **List Products**: Display all products currently in the inventory.
- **Edit Product**: Modify the quantity and price of an existing product.
- **Remove Product**: Remove a product from the inventory.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in a C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).
3. Build and run the program.
4. The application will display a menu with the following options:
    - Add Product
    - List Products
    - Edit Product
    - Remove Product
    - Exit

## Requirements

- .NET Framework 5.0 or higher
- A C# compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio)

## Example

Here’s how the menu will appear when running the program:

```csharp
----- Inventory Control -----

Add Product
List Products
Edit Product
Remove Product
Exit
Choose an option:
```

Follow the prompts to add, list, edit, or remove products in the inventory.

### Key Changes:
- Added "the" before "name, quantity, and price" for consistency.
- Corrected the code block format in the "Example" section to use proper syntax highlighting.
- Minor wording adjustments for better flow.
